# CYPHER_PROTOCOL

![](ZZZ/ZZZ.jpg)

* [PROJECT LINK GITHUB](https://github.com/P-Y-R-O-B-O-T/CYPHER_PROTOCOL)
* [PROJECT LINK PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/cypher-protocol-P-Y-R-O-B-O-T/)

* This is a type of communication protocol made for computers using TCP sockets.

* This is a highly secure and trust worthy protocol made using tcp sockets. It uses aggressively secure encryption AES-128 bit algorithm both the ways for a tight security

# ISSUES WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

* Other protocols give errors when some error occurs and we have to handle it manually to remove it or to continue the process in the same sequence but CYPHER_PROTOCOL does that error handling automatically and the programmers are more free to focus on the flow instead of error handling.

* Whenever some error occurs in recieving data or sending data it resolves it automatically.

* Whenever it notices a disconnection from server it automatically re-connects to the server.

# COMPATIBLITY

* CYPHER_PROTOCOL works with Linux, OS-X, and Windows (OS INDEPENDENT).

* But it may give better experience on linux.

# INSTALLATION

> Install it using pip.

* Goto [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/cypher-protocol-P-Y-R-O-B-O-T/)

# HOW TO USE ?

* Encryption key is a 32 character encryption key for the server and decryption key for client
* Decryption key is a 32 character decryption key for server and encryption key for the client
* Although encryption and decryption key can be kept same for any reason
* request_processor in server initialisation is a method/function that user have to define and it is used to process the request recieved from client
* responce_processor in client initialisation is a method/function that user have to define and it is used to process the responce recieved from server

* Server's request handler recieves the request in the form :

```
{
"PATH": str,
"OPERATION": str,
"DATA": YOUR_DATA_HERE,
"METADATA": dict
}
```

* But it can also be modified as per needs

* "PATH" is like the path we see in http protocol and here it is "/" by default
* "OPERATION" is operation we have to perform like "UPDATE", "DELETE", "READ", "CREATE" etc. Also you can create your own type of operation if you want to, its just for convenience
* "DATA" contains data that you want to share between the server and the client
* "METADATA" contains data that you may need to use, its completely optional
